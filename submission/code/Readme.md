# Sentiment Detection Project
In this project I set out to develop a classifier which can classify sentiment in video at various frame rates and resolutions.
The code is split into two folders:

- `notebooks` : contains code used to collect results, and display them in a readable way. Additionally, this is the code I used to test the architectures, and make sure that they worked - the code within is less up-to-date than in `server_code`. pdfs of notebooks are also included.
- `server_code` : contains the code used to train architectures and perform classification.

There is also a `utils` fodler - a python module I created to collect code needed to create models I needed and load datasets.
